# NEVER SPLIT THE PARTY
June 2020

(https://carolineverpoorten.github.io/js-rpg/)

## The Project:
We had to code a VS. style RPG fighting game to train ourselves with our usage of Javascript. 
The game included mechanics that depended on the race and item the players chose.

## The Game:
The game is a VS. style fighting game. The two players choose the name, race and item of their characters and the fighting
can begin. Each action is logged and affect the health of the characters, certain races and items can randomly launch
effects during attacks and healing.
