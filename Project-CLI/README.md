# Holidates-CLI

Enter this line in your terminal:

> $ holidates {country} {year}

As result, you will have a tool to get the holidays of the current year for the given country. Always useful.

Make sure that the country is in English and begins with an uppercase letter.
If you don't enter a specific year, the tool will return the holidays from the current year.
