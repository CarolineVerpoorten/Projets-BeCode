## The exercice:

As an exercice to learn HTML and SCSS/CSS, we had to follow example images to create a website in small team. Each of us had to code part of it.

We are a team of junior developers and we have been contacted by a mr. John Lafrite to code the front-end of a website for one of his clients: Supro, a company working in the fashion industry.
